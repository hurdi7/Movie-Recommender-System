# Movie-Recommender-System
This project is a <b>Content-Based Movie Recommender System</b> built using machine learning techniques.

It recommends movies similar to a selected movie based on features like genre, keywords, cast, and overview using <b>cosine similarity</b>.

The model was built and tested locally, and is ready for deployment.
